Key developments:

1. Many-to-Many multilingual translation model(non-English-Centric models) that can translate directly between any pair of 100 languages.
2. Covers thousands of language directions in training data.
3. Transformer-based neural machine translation models.

4. Controls the distribution of word tokens for different languages found using [SentencePiece](https://web.archive.org/web/20210126045439/https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) from multilingual dataset.
5. A special token in the encoder indicating the source language and a
   special token in the decoder indicating the target language were added.
6. Evaluated the quality of translations with [BLEU](https://web.archive.org/web/20210125155630/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU) and Human evaluation.
7. Built parallel corpus of multilingual translation text using [LASER](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130004845/https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER) embeddings, FAISS indexing(checking semantic similarity) and from mided data from [CCMatrix](https://web.archive.org/web/20201121182319/https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER/tree/master/tasks/CCMatrix), CCAligned projects.
8. Bitext data were mined based on language families and bridge languages.

</p>

9. Languages were grouped by linguistic similarity, geographic and cultural proximity.

10. Selective augmenting Bitext Data with Backtranslation
11. Added Language-Specific layers to Pre-Trained Transformers(at the
end of the decoder) for improving performance.
